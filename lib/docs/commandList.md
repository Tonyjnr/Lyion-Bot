# Command List

This document is deprecated in favor of the dynamic in-app menu.

For a complete and always up-to-date list of available commands, please use the `menu` command directly with the bot.

### Usage

To see all available commands, type:

```
+menu
```

The `menu` command dynamically generates a list of all registered commands, grouped by category, ensuring the information is always accurate.
